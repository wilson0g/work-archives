"""Automated review orchestration: deterministic checks, semantic reviewer passes, and
risk scoring, tying authoring/review/'s pure modules together into one
AutomatedReviewReport per candidate.

Why this is state-aware quality control, not consciousness: every decision here is a
fixed function of the current candidate, its deterministic checks, and however many
reviewer passes ran -- there is no persistent internal state, no self-directed goal, and
no memory beyond the immutable reports this module writes. "State-aware" means the
system tracks *pipeline* state (which stage a job is in, which content hash was already
reviewed) so it can act efficiently and avoid redundant work, not that it has any model
of itself.

Human vs. automated responsibilities: this module (and everything it calls) may only
ever produce a recommendation and risk assessment. Nothing here writes
CurationItem.final_review_status -- that field is set exclusively by
authoring.grounded_review.approve_revision/approve_as_written/reject_item, all of which
require an explicit human reviewer identity. A "low" risk_level and
"recommend_human_approval" recommendation still leaves the item pending; this milestone
does not auto-promote any conceptual item.

Risk levels: see authoring/review/risk.py. Low = every deterministic check passed, the
answer was independently verified, no ambiguity, every claim grounded, objective/intent
aligned, defensible difficulty, a known reviewer/prompt version, no duplicate, confidence
thresholds met. Medium/high = specific, named gaps. Critical = a factual, ambiguity, or
grounding failure, or a malformed/hallucinating reviewer output.

Backpressure: see authoring/review/backpressure.py and authoring/review/config.py's
ReviewPolicyConfig -- pending-per-skill and total-backlog caps stop new generation, they
never touch review or promotion of what's already pending. Reviewer calls are cached by
content hash (report_store.latest_for_hash) so an unchanged candidate is never reviewed
twice, and bounded per job tick by ReviewPolicyConfig.max_calls_per_job_tick (enforced by
the caller in authoring/replenishment/worker.py, not this module).

Modal usage: the default reviewer_provider is "fake" (FakeContentReviewer); a real
review call only happens when authoring/replenishment/cli.py is configured with
QUIZ_REVIEW_REVIEWER_PROVIDER=modal, using the same authenticated Modal endpoint
generation already uses (authoring/replenishment/modal_inference.py).

Calibration: authoring/review/reliability.py aggregates past reports into
rejection/revision rates by generator+reviewer+skill configuration; a flagged
configuration cannot reach "low" risk (is_calibrated_configuration below) until a human
recalibrates it. evaluation/review_calibration.py runs this against a held-out
positive/negative set to report precision/recall thresholds -- it is an evaluation
harness, not a training procedure, and never modifies the reviewer.

LLM-as-judge limitations: a reviewer model can hallucinate a reference or option that
does not exist (guarded by response_parser.validate_reviewer_assessments and treated as
critical/require_full_human_review), agree with itself twice, or share blind spots with
the generator model if they are the same model. Multi-pass consistency (risk.score_risk's
disagreement handling) catches instability, not shared blind spots -- a human remains the
final authority on every conceptual item.

Changing prompt/policy versions: bump REVIEW_PROMPT_VERSION in
authoring/review/prompt.py and/or ReviewPolicyConfig.review_policy_version explicitly,
add or update the corresponding regression test, and never let this module infer a new
version from its own output -- there is no online self-modification here.
