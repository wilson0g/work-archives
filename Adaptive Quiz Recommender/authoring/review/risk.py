"""Deterministic risk-scoring policy over review results.

The reviewer LLM never assigns the final risk decision. This module turns deterministic
checks and one or more semantic reviewer passes into a risk level and recommendation
using fixed rules, so the same inputs always produce the same decision -- the property
that makes the risk policy itself unit-testable without any model.
