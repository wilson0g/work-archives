"""Whether a result is about the skill that went looking for it.

The allowlist says which sites may be read. It cannot say whether a page is on
topic, and the first HTML-first live pilot showed exactly that gap: fifteen
candidates off reviewed domains, of which two or three were about AI search at
all. MIT OpenCourseWare on its own supplied electromagnetic field theory,
computational mechanics of materials, probabilistic systems analysis, feedback
control and functional analysis - every one a real page on an approved domain,
and none of them able to ground "what is a transition model".

So relevance is a second layer, deliberately separate from the allowlist. The
allowlist stays the network boundary and decides what may be fetched; this
decides what is worth a reviewer's attention once it has been read. Nothing
here approves anything: a page that scores well is still pending, and the
score exists to remove the obvious false positives rather than to judge the
rest.

Scoring is term overlap and nothing cleverer, and it is written down rather
than inferred. A candidate carries the terms it matched and the total they
came to, so a reviewer can see why it survived - and so a threshold that turns
out to be wrong can be argued with from the record instead of from memory.
