"""The first retrieval-assisted authoring run: AI-SRC-01, AI-SRC-02, AI-SRC-08.

Three generated, understand-level search skills that carry no reference
material yet, which is what makes them the honest test of the workflow.

This module plans the run and can execute it against an injected provider. It
writes nothing: references.csv stays as it is until the candidates it produces
have been read and approved, and which domains are trustworthy for a course is
a review decision, not one retrieval gets to make for itself.

# field theory for "problem formulation" and functional analysis for
# "heuristic search" - both real pages, both on an approved domain, neither of
# any use. cs50.harvard.edu is one domain and two courses, and the live run
# collected the introductory programming one.
#
# So the priority order is per skill and per path. The allowlist remains the
# only thing that decides what may be fetched, while these reviewed paths are
# a separate relevance prerequisite: being inside one permits a page to be
# scored, but does not prove that it covers the concept or objective.
