"""SQL-backed (SQLite or PostgreSQL) replenishment job queue.

One row tracks one skill's replenishment episode end to end. `job_type`
starts as "replenish_skill" and is advanced in place by the worker as the
episode moves through retrieval, generation, and promotion -- there is only
ever one active row per (course_id, skill_id), enforced by a partial unique
index rather than application-level locking, so repeated Streamlit reruns or
concurrent `scan` invocations cannot create duplicates.

This mirrors the connect/schema/transaction conventions of
bkt/sqlite_repository.py, but is a standalone repository: the worker runs as
a separate CLI process from Streamlit, and the two must be able to share the
database without either blocking the other -- hence WAL mode and
BEGIN IMMEDIATE transactions on SQLite (see database.py).

        (status='permanent_failure', error_code='demand_already_satisfied') -- the

        another operator, or a genuinely different failure recorded under this
