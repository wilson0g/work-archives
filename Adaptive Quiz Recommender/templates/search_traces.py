"""BFS, DFS, uniform-cost and greedy best-first expansion-order templates.

Each one shows the learner a graph and asks for the expansion order. They share
the instance generator and question shape; they differ in how the frontier is
ordered, which distractors a confused learner would fall for, and whether the
heuristic is worth showing at all.
