"""Generate the three-course content-review packet directly from the exact final
approved-bank artifacts and their GroundedReviewStore records -- never hand-authored.

Every card's HTML is built from the same BankItem the approved-bank JSONL contains, and
each card is stamped with question_content_hash(item.question) (the same function
QuestionRevision uses to self-validate its own content_hash field) so the packet's
displayed content can be verified byte-for-byte against the bank on disk: recomputing
the hash from the bank file and comparing it to the badge is the whole check --
scripts/verify_packet_hashes.py does exactly that.

Run with: python -m scripts.generate_content_review_packet

    <h2>Round 3: what changed</h2>
    <p>
      Albert's adversarial review of the round-2 packet found the packet itself was stale for
      DB-ERM-01-INT-03 (still displaying the disputed cardinality-direction question, with an
      explanation claiming '1' and 'n' mean minimum/maximum relationship counts &mdash; both
      wrong) even though the approved bank already carried the correct placement-focused
      replacement. Regenerating this packet directly from the bank/review-store artifacts (this
      script) fixes that class of bug structurally: the packet can no longer disagree with the
      bank, because it is derived from the same source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regenerating also surfaced a second, deeper defect in the same item: the round-2
      replacement had only ever been hand-written into the approved-bank JSONL &mdash; the
      GroundedReviewStore's CurationItem for DB-ERM-01-208a6d1c67c7e626 still pointed at the
      original disputed content, with no QuestionRevision recording the replacement. A bank
      regenerated from the review store (the intended single source of truth) would have
      silently reverted to the disputed question. This is now recorded as a proper
      QuestionRevision, using the genuine fresh-generation provenance already on disk at
      <span class="mono">outputs/grounded-database-systems-v1-erm03-fix/</span>.
    </p>
    <p>Six further items had genuine single-answer or accuracy defects, each corrected, re-run through deterministic checks, the live Modal semantic reviewer, and an independent Claude review:</p>
    <ul class="check-list">
      <li>DSA-CPX-01-INT-02 &mdash; two true options (constant-factor / Big-O framing); replaced the second with a false claim.</li>
      <li>DSA-SRC-01-INT-02 &mdash; "sorted in ascending order" was stronger than the algorithm requires; stem now names the standard ascending-order algorithm explicitly.</li>
      <li>DSA-STK-01-INT-04 &mdash; "store in order received" and "store in order processed" were not mutually exclusive in the scenario; replaced with a priority-queue distractor.</li>
      <li>LA-DET-01-INT-01 &mdash; two options both correctly implied non-invertibility; replaced the redundant one with a false, non-equivalent claim.</li>
      <li>LA-EIG-01-INT-04 &mdash; determinant and trace distractors were also true of similar matrices; replaced with false claims about eigenvectors and diagonalizability.</li>
      <li>DB-IDX-01-INT-03 &mdash; the marked option contradicted its own explanation about leaf-node contents; reworded both to the implementation-neutral "data entries."</li>
      <li>DB-ERM-01-INT-03 &mdash; traceability reconciliation only (see above); displayed content is unchanged.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Two items named in Albert's review were checked and left unchanged, because the fix as literally specified would have made them wrong:</p>
    <ul class="check-list">
      <li class="caveat">DSA-HSH-01-INT-02 and INT-03 ("appended" to the chain) &mdash; the approved reference (DSA-HSH-01-a15ab46be9fd) explicitly states "the new item is simply appended to the end of the linked list already stored at that index." Albert's own instruction carved out exactly this case ("unless the approved reference explicitly defines an append-only implementation"). Changed nothing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A fresh adversarial exact-one-answer audit was then run across all 80 cards (not just the flagged items) for factual accuracy, missing premises, duplicate/equivalent options, implementation-dependent generalizations, contradictory explanations, and answer leakage. No further defects were found; the full card listing below is that audit's record.</p>

    <h2>Verification</h2>
    <ul class="check-list">
      <li>All 7 corrected/reconciled items pass deterministic checks (authoring/review/deterministic.py): exactly-four-options, distinct-after-normalization, correct_answer matches an option, non-empty explanation, no unresolved placeholders, length limits, no duplicate item/question text.</li>
      <li>All 7 pass a live semantic-reviewer pass on the authenticated Modal endpoint (meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct): <span class="mono">recommend_human_approval/low</span>, zero blocking reasons, zero warnings, for every one.</li>
      <li>All 7 independently re-reviewed by Claude; the specific justification is recorded in each card's review note above.</li>
      <li>All three approved banks re-validated with scripts/validate_approved_bank.py: DSA 28/28, Linear Algebra 24/24, Database Systems 28/28 &mdash; unique item IDs, unique normalized stems, exact required-skill coverage, zero unknown skill IDs, status <span class="mono">ready</span>.</li>

      <li>The pre-existing export_approved_bank_items() StopIteration bug (raised for any approve_as_written item, approved with zero revisions) reported in the round-3 packet is now fixed directly in authoring/grounded_review.py, with regression coverage in tests/test_grounded_review.py and an end-to-end replenishment-promotion test in tests/test_replenishment_worker.py. All three courses' banks were re-exported from their canonical GroundedReviewStore artifacts through the fixed shared exporter and are byte-for-byte identical to what is committed here &mdash; no content changed. The local workaround exporter (scripts/export_course_bank.py) has been removed; scripts/review_grounded_batch.py's <span class="mono">export</span> command is the one authoritative export path outside the worker.</li>
