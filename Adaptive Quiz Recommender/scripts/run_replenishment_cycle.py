"""Bounded, reportable replenishment run for the scheduled GitHub Actions
workflow (.github/workflows/replenishment.yml).

This is a thin orchestration layer over the existing, unmodified pipeline
(authoring/replenishment/{cli,worker,jobs,policy,inventory}.py): in live
mode it scans the four active course manifests, enqueues deficient skills
exactly the way `python -m authoring.replenishment.cli scan` already does,
then drives the worker loop for at most a few new skill episodes per run
under an explicit call/cost budget (authoring/replenishment/budget.py),
snapshotting every touched job's artifacts to a job-scoped, git-committable
directory (authoring/replenishment/snapshot.py) so a GitHub-hosted
(ephemeral) runner can resume later runs purely from PostgreSQL job state
plus whatever the caller checked out of the content-ops branch.

    python -m scripts.run_replenishment_cycle --dry-run
    python -m scripts.run_replenishment_cycle

--dry-run performs the same read-only inventory/deficiency scan and produces
the identical report, but writes nothing anywhere: no job is enqueued,
updated, claimed, or processed; no branch artifact or PR is created; no
Brave/Modal/reviewer call is made; no bank or lifecycle state changes. Each
would-be-enqueued row instead carries a deterministic_job_key() (report.py)
so the report can be read as "these are the jobs this would enqueue" without
ever calling repository.enqueue().
