"""Consolidated candidate-review packet for the bounded intro-ai foundations
release candidate (batch grounded-ai-fnd-release-v1: AI-FND-03, AI-FND-04).

AI-FND-03 has been approved by Albert Quainoo (genuine human review, recorded via
authoring.grounded_review.approve_revision). AI-FND-04's original candidate was
rejected by Albert for semantically overlapping options; a human revision was
proposed, preserving the original as calibration evidence, and given a fresh full
review pass -- still pending. Nothing here has been promoted to the active bank
or deployed.
